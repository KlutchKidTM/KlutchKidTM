- 👋 Hi, I’m @KlutchKidTM
- 👀 I’m interested in videogames, like Trackmania for instance. Love it! (...and SEKIRO: Shadows Die Twice/Black opd 6) I'm interested in learning deep into the mechanics and physics of a game to help understand what causes what and when it happens. This could be anything.
        I am extremely hyperactive and have a lot of drive to meet or exceed my goals. When I learn a new found Knowledge, it's something that I like to share with people. Even if they think I'm crazy lol.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ice mechanics.. and everything else. Mapping too.

 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on physics and mechanics in all styles TM. Anything else anyone may or may not need help with. WILLING TO LEARN if you're WILLING TO TEACH.
